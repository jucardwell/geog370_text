{"title":"Doing Spatial Analysis in QGIS","markdown":{"headingText":"Doing Spatial Analysis in QGIS","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis chapter introduces common spatial analysis tools and demonstrates how to use them in QGIS. While spatial questions often require combining multiple tools in sequence, you are not expected to design these workflows from scratch. Instead, the focus here is on learning to apply specific tools to explore data, interpret results, and better understand geographic patterns.\n\nThis chapter will explore the use of vector and raster geoprocessing tools to explore three spatial questions. In addition, it will ask you to critically examine the questions, methods, and data in a critical GIS style.\n\n## Research Question 1\n\nWhere is the intersection between vulnerable populations and existing permitted facilities that require a [Major Air](https://www.epa.gov/title-v-operating-permits/who-has-obtain-title-v-permit#:~:text=A%20major%20source%20has%20actual,are%20in%20non%2Dattainment)) permit in North Carolina? \n\n### [Download Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AiEDyWe4eEemWIknTu1ZwtY4uy7U1vs3?usp=sharing)\n\n-   2010 Census Block Group Median Household Income (from 2013 American Community Survey)\n-   Current (June 2025) Major Air permits from [EPA Geospatial Data](https://www.epa.gov/frs/epa-frs-facilities-state-single-file-csv-download)\n\n### [Add Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GjghgJYUXyrWKntIAjyrxC7Qfsu3JxeC/view?usp=sharing)\n\nWe can add tabular data to QGIS as long as we can execute a table join (so it has a matching key with a geographic data file) or the tabular file includes coordinates. We’ll first add our air permit data. You must know the coordinate system of the data (which should be in the metadata) to add it correctly. We’ll also add our processed census data, which we table joined in a previous exercise. \n\n### [Select by Attribute](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4FnWpslNkCm3dlqCrsoe_PbR2HrI57d/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Selecting by attribute allows you to filter all of the records in a dataset based on the values in one of the variables. Features that meet the criteria will become \"selected\"**\n\nFirst, we will want to filter the census block group data to include only block groups that meet our “vulnerable population” classification (median household income \\< 4500). We will do this by selecting by attribute, which is an example of querying. \n\n### [Reproject](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ixetgny0S7-egC524YsioCpgb_0rn_rb/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Reprojecting data allows you to convert a GCS or PCS to a different GCS or PCS. You would do this to o match the coordinate system used by other datasets in your project, or to enable specific types of spatial analysis that require a projected coordinate system (such as calculating area or distance).**\n\nAs you may have noticed, the tabular dataset representing locations with major air quality permits is in a Geographic Coordinate System, not a projected one. Given that we are going to be doing distance-based analysis, we must reproject that data. We typically want to make sure that all our datasets are in the same projection, so we will reproject the data to match the projection of our census block group data (EPSG:2264). \n\n### [Buffer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggshHrtTIbXJmC5VmAIm1ytbNpZwkSpv/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**A buffer is a new area generated around a point, line, or polygon feature to identify everything within a certain distance**\n\nNow we want to identify areas within 1 mile of existing permitted facilities by buffering our facility dataset (which is currently points)\n\n### [Intersect](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IO9kM_fyRCc-DOCORLI1s_n_mZUAZafY/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**An intersect identifies the spatial overlap between two or more layers, creating a new dataset that contains only the features or portions of features where the layers intersect.** \n\nTo find the intersection between vulnerable populations and areas proximate to high polluting facilities, we will use the intersect tool. Intersects retain the attributes of both of the layers, whereas a clip, which would have visually the same output, retains the attributes only of the input layer, not the overlay layer. \n\n### Critical Questions to Ask:\n\n-   What assumptions are embedded in defining \"vulnerable populations\" based solely on median household income?\n-   Why do we choose a 1-mile buffer, and what are the implications of this distance?\n-   What is the source of the EPA permit data, and what might be missing?\n-   This analysis uses 2010 block group data from the 2013 American Community Survey. What are the risks of using outdated demographic data for present-day decision-making?\n-   What are the implications of using the census block group as the unit of analysis?\n\n## Research Question 2\n\nHow many addresses are served by each park in Chapel Hill? \n\n### [Download Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZPdJ9a26eqOSYpm3PIzZOcrgtWFaqJrB?usp=sharing)\n\n-   Address points from [Orange County GIS](https://www.orangecountync.gov/2057/Download-GIS-Data)\n-   Parks from [Chapel Hill Open Data](https://opendata-townofchapelhill.hub.arcgis.com/search?q=parks)\n-   Chapel Hill boundaries from [Chapel Hill Open Data](https://opendata-townofchapelhill.hub.arcgis.com/search?q=parks)\n\n### Reproject\n\nAs always, we want to make sure that our data shares the same coordinate system before beginning spatial analysis. You should notice that the address and Chapel Hill boundary datasets are in EPSG:2264 and the parks dataset is in EPSG:3857. These are both projected coordinate systems, however EPSG:2264 is a local projection built for North Carolina. EPSG:3857 is a more globally focused projection. Since EPSG:2264 would be slightly more accurate for North Carolina, reproject the parks to EPSG:2264\n\n### [Clip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hu7CZzJRHemkV4PYUcd1DrR1wOB2Wigo/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**A clip trims one layer using the boundaries of another, keeping only the features (or parts of features) that fall within the clip layer’s extent.** \n\nWe now want to clip the address dataset so that we just have addresses within the Chapel Hill boundary. A clip will just retain the attributes of the address dataset and will not include the attributes of the boundary dataset. \n\n### [Calculate Service Area](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FSdIwj-8wy9IkAP2_WfA6c9sBD1rNbiD/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**A service area represents the geographic region that can be reached from a location within a given travel distance or time, often used to model accessibility.**\n\nFollow [these instructions](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/service_area_analysis.html) to download the ORS plugin. Then calculate 10 minute isochrones from each park. Note that when you save the data (which is produced in EPSG:2264) you can set the PCS of the output so it reprojects when it saves. \n\n### [Spatial Join](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f5sC-stNCu5kVeiGtJLp_KcnUFkuTpdR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**A spatial join transfers attribute data from one layer to another based on their spatial relationship (like containment, intersection, or proximity).**\n\nThere is not a common “key” field between the service areas and our address data. Instead, the commonality between these two datasets is their spatial location. Therefore, to join these two datasets, we will use a spatial join. In this case, we will do a “join attributes by location (summary)” since we want to summarize the number of address points within each service area polygon. If we were interested in assigning each address point the name of the park whose service area it falls within we would use a regular spatial join (called “Join attributes by location” in QGIS). This type of join appends the attributes of one layer to another based on spatial relationships like intersection, containment, or proximity, but does not summarize counts or statistics.\n\n### Critical Questions to Ask:\n\n-   What assumptions are we making when we define 'served' as being within a 10-minute isochrone from a park?\n-   How does the ORS plugin model pedestrian access, and what does it ignore?\n-   Are addresses a good stand-in for people?\n-   What does “serving” an address mean, physically, socially, or politically?\n-   Does a 10-minute walk on a map mean that it’s safe, comfortable, or desirable to walk there in real life?\n-   What would it take to integrate community knowledge into this analysis?\n\n## Research Question 3\n\nWhich areas of Buncombe County are most vulnerable to wildfire? \n\n### [Download Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rwdyyd9IdyjMN0AHoRJJuywjxFafNMOL?usp=sharing)\n\n-   2023 National Land Cover Database [MLRC](https://www.mrlc.gov/data)\n\n-   Buncombe County DEM from [North Carolina Spatial Data Download](https://sdd.nc.gov/)\n\n-   Buncombe County Zip Codes from [Buncombe County Open Data](https://data.buncombecounty.org/datasets/buncombe-county-zip-codes)\n\n### [Calculate Slope](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16hRLJ2XAgy7hGjxSDSBQNkH8lzrontbh/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Calculate slope determines the steepness or incline of a surface, usually from a digital elevation model (DEM), expressed in degrees or percent rise.** \n\nUse the Buncombe County DEM to calculate slope using the slope tool. The output will be a continuous raster showing degrees of steepness. Areas with steeper slopes are generally more vulnerable to wildfire spread.\n\nThe output is in a Projected Coordinate System. However, we will then reproject the slope raster to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) to match the coordinate system of the NLCD dataset. This may seem like a weird choice (reprojecting data in a projected coordinate system into a geographic coordinate system). However, this approach avoids reprojecting the NLCD data, which is important because the NLCD data is a categorical raster. Reprojecting categorical rasters introduces a higher risk of distortion due to resampling. To preserve the integrity of the land cover classes, we keep the NLCD in its original form and instead reproject the slope raster, which is continuous data and more resilient to interpolation.\n\n### [Reclassify Rasters](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-kb_75ikTeXTaToIS8aeudbd8vQvhrMm/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Reclassifying a raster means assigning new values to ranges or categories of existing raster cell values. It is often used to simplify data, group values into categories, or prepare a raster for analysis like suitability modeling.**\n\nWe will reclassify both the slope and land cover rasters onto a common risk scale from 1 (low risk) to 5 (high risk).\n\n-   For slope, use thresholds based on terrain steepness (e.g., 0–5 degrees = 1, 35–65 = 5).\n-   For NLCD, reclassify land cover values based on their flammability (e.g., forest = 5, developed = 1–2).\n\nUse the r.reclass tool and copy-paste the provided reclass rules for each raster. The output of each will be a categorical risk raster.\n\n#### Slope\n\n|                |              |                     |                 |\n|----------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| From (degrees) | To (degrees) | Output (Risk Score) | Slope Category  |\n| 0              | 5            | 1                   | Very Low Slope  |\n| 5              | 15           | 2                   | Low Slope       |\n| 15             | 25           | 3                   | Moderate Slope  |\n| 25             | 35           | 4                   | High Slope      |\n| 35             | 65           | 5                   | Very High Slope |\n\nThis is what to paste in the “Reclass rules text”:\n\n0 thru 5 = 1\n\n5 thru 15 = 2\n\n15 thru 25 = 3\n\n25 thru 35 = 4\n\n35 thru 65 = 5\n\n\\* = NULL\n\n#### NLCD\n\n|       |                     |                              |\n|-------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| Value | Output (Risk Score) | NLCD Class                   |\n| 11    | 1                   | Open Water                   |\n| 21    | 2                   | Developed, Open Space        |\n| 22    | 2                   | Developed, Low Intensity     |\n| 23    | 2                   | Developed, Medium Intensity  |\n| 24    | 1                   | Developed, High Intensity    |\n| 31    | 3                   | Barren Land                  |\n| 41    | 5                   | Deciduous Forest             |\n| 42    | 5                   | Evergreen Forest             |\n| 43    | 5                   | Mixed Forest                 |\n| 52    | 4                   | Shrub/Scrub                  |\n| 71    | 4                   | Grassland/Herbaceous         |\n| 81    | 3                   | Pasture/Hay                  |\n| 82    | 2                   | Cultivated Crops             |\n| 90    | 2                   | Woody Wetlands               |\n| 95    | 2                   | Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands |\n\nThis is what to paste in the “Reclass rules text” \n\n11 = 1\n\n21 = 2\n\n22 = 2\n\n23 = 2\n\n24 = 1\n\n31 = 3\n\n41 = 5\n\n42 = 5\n\n43 = 5\n\n52 = 4\n\n71 = 4\n\n81 = 3\n\n82 = 2\n\n90 = 2\n\n95 = 2\n\n\\* = NULL\n\n### [Raster Math](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Q2P0skgUM5hooLbDu-lsDGYvTLnGPYf/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Raster math refers to performing mathematical operations on raster layers, cell-by-cell. It allows you to combine, compare, or transform raster datasets using arithmetic expressions (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).**\n\nNow we combine the two reclassified rasters using the Raster Calculator. This step adds the slope and land cover risk scores, producing a composite vulnerability raster that reflects both terrain and vegetation.This technique is an example of a Multi-Criteria Overlay Analysis (MCOA) which is  a method used to combine multiple spatial layers, each representing a different factor contributing to a phenomenon (in this case, wildfire risk). Each layer is first standardized (here, using a 1–5 risk scale), then combined to create a single index or score. By summing the slope and land cover risk scores, we are weighting them equally (50% each). This assumes that slope and vegetation are equally important in determining wildfire vulnerability. In more complex analyses, different layers might be given different weights to reflect their relative importance.\n\nWhen performing raster math, QGIS will automatically resample rasters on the fly so that their cell alignments and resolutions match. However, this may introduce interpolation artifacts. If high precision is required, you should explicitly resample the input rasters beforehand using the “Resample” tool. Multiple resampling methods exist (e.g., nearest neighbor, bilinear, cubic), and the appropriate one depends on the input data.\n\n### [Zonal Statistics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11chHm49JRTpxSGSLR0ElhPMdrEbNJ53y/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Zonal statistics calculates summary statistics (like mean, sum, max, or standard deviation) for raster values within the boundaries of defined zones from another dataset—typically a polygon layer.**\n\nTo summarize vulnerability by administrative unit, we use zonal statistics (which summarizes raster values based on vector boundaries). Input the ZIP code polygons and the combined wildfire risk raster. Calculate the mean value for each ZIP code. This gives an average vulnerability score (ranging roughly from 2 to 10) that reflects the average risk across each ZIP code.\n\n### Critical Questions to Ask\n\n-   How does the choice of administrative unit (ZIP codes) shape our understanding of vulnerability?\n-   What assumptions are embedded in the risk classification thresholds for slope and land cover?\n-   What important variables are missing from this model of wildfire vulnerability?\n-   What are the limitations of using a strictly biophysical model for a hazard with complex social consequences?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"doing_spatial_analysis.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
